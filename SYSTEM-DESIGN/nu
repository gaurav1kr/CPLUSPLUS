In Synchronous transmission, data is sent in form of blocks or frames
There is no gap present between data. It is reliable.

In asynchronous data transfer , data is sent in the form of byte or character. This transmission is half duplex. 
In this transmission start bits and stop bits are added with data. It doesn't require syncrhonization

Synchronous transmission is fast while asynchronous data transfer is slow.

Synchronous transmission is costly while asynchronous data transfter is economical.

In Synchronous transmission , there is no gap present between data. In Async transmission , there is present gap between data.
