Proxy server is intermediary hardware / software that sits between client and server
It us used to filter requests :-
--> Log requests
--> Transform requests by adding/removing headers.
--> Encrypting / decrypting or compression

Filtering reques is done by ACL control.

when client sends a request to the server, it first goes on proxy server and if it is valid request it sends 
request to server, get a response from server and respond it to client. This is used on blocking sites in an organisation.


Benefits :-
--> It has it's own cache and can server a lot of requests.
--> It can coordinate requests from multiple servers and can be used to optimize request traffic.
