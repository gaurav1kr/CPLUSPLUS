RAII :- 
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is C++ technique which control the life cycle of resource. It is a class variant and is tied to object life time.

It encapsulates several resources into class where resource allocation is done by constructor during object creation and resource deallocation is done by destructor during object destruction.
Examples are smart ponters. auto initializion.

CODE-BLOATING
Production of code that is perceived unnecessary long ,slow and which cause unnecessary wastage of resources. 
Examples :- 
a)Functions defined inside class (By default compiler detects it online and copy the content as many times it is called)
b)Printing constants string using variable :-
string str("gaurav kumar") ; // unncessary calling string constructor 
cout<<str ;
