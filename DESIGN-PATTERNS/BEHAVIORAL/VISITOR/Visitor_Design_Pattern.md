# Visitor Design Pattern

The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate operations from the objects on which they operate. It is particularly useful when you want to perform multiple distinct operations on a group of objects without modifying their classes. 

## Key Concepts:
1. **Visitor Interface**:
   - Declares methods for all the operations you can perform on object structures.
   - Each method corresponds to a specific class of objects.

2. **Concrete Visitor**:
   - Implements the operations declared in the Visitor interface.
   - Provides specific behavior for each object type.

3. **Element Interface**:
   - Declares an `accept` method that takes a Visitor object as a parameter.

4. **Concrete Element**:
   - Implements the `accept` method, usually calling the Visitor's corresponding method.

5. **Object Structure**:
   - A collection of elements that can be iterated and visited.

## Real-Life Use Case: Tax Calculation for Different Products

### Problem:
Suppose a shopping cart contains different product types (e.g., books, electronics, and clothing). Each product has a unique tax calculation rule. Instead of implementing tax logic inside each product class, the Visitor pattern separates the tax calculation from the product classes.

### Steps:
1. Define a visitor interface for tax calculation.
2. Implement a concrete visitor for tax calculation.
3. Define element classes for each product type.
4. Allow the visitor to process these elements via their `accept` method.

## C++ Implementation:

Here's an example illustrating the Visitor pattern for tax calculation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

// Forward declaration of Visitor
class TaxVisitor;

// Element interface
class Product {
public:
    virtual ~Product() = default;
    virtual void accept(TaxVisitor& visitor) = 0; // Accept method
};

// Visitor interface
class TaxVisitor {
public:
    virtual ~TaxVisitor() = default;
    virtual void visitBook(class Book& book) = 0;
    virtual void visitElectronics(class Electronics& electronics) = 0;
    virtual void visitClothing(class Clothing& clothing) = 0;
};

// Concrete Element: Book
class Book : public Product {
public:
    double price;
    Book(double price) : price(price) {}
    void accept(TaxVisitor& visitor) override {
        visitor.visitBook(*this);
    }
};

// Concrete Element: Electronics
class Electronics : public Product {
public:
    double price;
    Electronics(double price) : price(price) {}
    void accept(TaxVisitor& visitor) override {
        visitor.visitElectronics(*this);
    }
};

// Concrete Element: Clothing
class Clothing : public Product {
public:
    double price;
    Clothing(double price) : price(price) {}
    void accept(TaxVisitor& visitor) override {
        visitor.visitClothing(*this);
    }
};

// Concrete Visitor: TaxCalculator
class TaxCalculator : public TaxVisitor {
public:
    void visitBook(Book& book) override {
        std::cout << "Book price: " << book.price << ", Tax: " << book.price * 0.05 << std::endl;
    }
    void visitElectronics(Electronics& electronics) override {
        std::cout << "Electronics price: " << electronics.price << ", Tax: " << electronics.price * 0.18 << std::endl;
    }
    void visitClothing(Clothing& clothing) override {
        std::cout << "Clothing price: " << clothing.price << ", Tax: " << clothing.price * 0.12 << std::endl;
    }
};

// Main function demonstrating the Visitor Pattern
int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Product>> cart;
    cart.push_back(std::make_unique<Book>(100.0));
    cart.push_back(std::make_unique<Electronics>(500.0));
    cart.push_back(std::make_unique<Clothing>(200.0));

    TaxCalculator taxCalculator;
    for (auto& product : cart) {
        product->accept(taxCalculator);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation of the Code:
1. **Product**: Abstract class representing items in the cart.
2. **Book, Electronics, Clothing**: Concrete implementations of `Product` with a price attribute.
3. **TaxVisitor**: Abstract visitor defining operations for each product type.
4. **TaxCalculator**: Concrete visitor implementing tax rules for different product types.
5. **Main**: Demonstrates how to use the Visitor pattern to calculate taxes without modifying the product classes.

## Advantages:
1. **Open/Closed Principle**:
   - Elements are open for extension (new visitors) without modifying existing code.
2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Business logic is separated from data structures.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Adding new operations is easy by creating new visitors.

---

## Disadvantages:
1. **Dependency on Element Interface**:
   - All elements must expose a visitor interface.
2. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Adding a new element type requires updating all visitors.

This pattern is ideal when you anticipate frequent changes to operations but infrequent changes to the structure of elements.
